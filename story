 lovely river called Nallar flows through the Chambal forest. There was a fox named Kullan. The Nallar River was home to several crocodiles. Mandu had an island with fruit trees in the middle of the river.


In the tree, a troop of monkeys lived. The crocodile Mandu and the fox Kullan got along well. One day, Mandavi, Mandu's wife, expressed to her husband that she desired to eat a monkey's heart. Mandu retorted that since monkeys resided in trees, it was challenging for him to trap one. But Mandavi stated that she needed to eat a monkey's heart since she had heard they were delicious. 


Mandu was disheartened. He was sobbing while he lay on the edge of the Nallar River, and Kullan, a friend of Mandu's, the fox, visited the river to drink water. When Kullan noticed Mandu crying, he asked, "Why are you so unhappy, my friend?" “Oh, my friend, my wicked wife wants to devour a monkey's heart,” Mandu retorted. Mandu burst into loud sobbing. "My friend, don't worry," Kullan reassured. For your benefit, I'm here. I'll give you a good idea for catching a monkey.
